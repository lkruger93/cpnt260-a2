# cpnt260-a2
assignment 2 the card for cpnt 260

this is a really cool card designed by Lauren Kruger for the course known as CPNT 260.  it is the second assignment and first card ever.
My love of weird things inspired this card so hopefully it's weird enough.  all code is my own and all pictures are fair use courtesy of zuckerberg and all my other friends from facebook.
